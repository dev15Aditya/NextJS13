# Next.js Profile Screen

This project is a simple Next.js application that renders a "profile screen." The profile data is hardcoded in the `data.ts` file in JSON format.
`The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Material-UI components.`

## Hosted Webpage

The application is hosted on Vercel. You can access it [here](https://next-js-13-gamma.vercel.app/).

### Profile Data

Profile data is stored in the data.ts file in JSON format. You can modify this file to update the profile information. It is located in /src/app

I have made separed component folder and wrapped it in page.tsx, It helped me to make development easy and fast.

`components` folder has 3 component.
